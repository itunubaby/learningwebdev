                I have been through alot, but I have always learnt that you have to be strong no matter what you face. I would like to introduce my self as DR. Itunubaby Oluwaseyi Ayoka.
                I was born june 14, 2001. I am a lover of sport. I am very patient and sometimes impatient. I am also people oriented, i love people, especially commmunicating with people and also caring for them.
                I know at times people might want to take that for granted, but i have always learnt that no matter how people might want to take that for granted I have to always be good and ignore people that would take me for granted.
                I love food. I am a very nice person and very sweet, honestly. I am the stage of my life where I am really scared of my future and i don't really know what it takes but I know it is going to be great and I know that I'm going to change the world.
